## Background
This interdisciplinary research project "Iconographics" is dedicated to innovative possibilities of digital image recognition for the arts and humanities. While computer vision is often already capable of identifying individual objects or specific artistic styles in images, the project faces the open problem of also digitally opening up the more complex image structures and contexts.

## Mission
On the basis of a close interdisciplinary cooperation between classical archaeology, Christian archaeology, art history and the computer sciences as well as in joint theoretical and methodical reflection, a large number of complex pictorial works are analyzed, compared and contextualized. The aim is to make the often very complex compositional, narrative and semantic structures of these images comprehensible for computer vision

## Technology
All the algorithms and tools are developed using Python, and most of the code and data are open-sourced. The computer vision problems are approached using style transfer, transfer learning, and domain shift understanding and generalisation. A new way of representing compositional features is presented using the combination of deep features generated from a network pretrained on real-world images and concepts from art history for better understanding of artworks and linking them.
